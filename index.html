<h2 align = "center"> Who I am</h2>
<h3>I live by the idea that you don't have to sacrifce design or functionality, to have the other.</h3>
<p align="center">
I'm a self taught visual designer, mixing both my educational background in technical programming and work experience
        I have with users on a daily basis together to design both visually pleasing and functioning digital products.<br> I've
        learned that right amount of knowledge in development, your audience and design can elevate a product to a whole other
        level that gives the user an experience worth returning to. <br>I'm currently a Junior at Tarleton State University working
        on a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Math and Spanish Language.
